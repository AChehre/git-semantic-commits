# Please note that:
#  - The HEADER is a single line of max. 72 characters that         
#    contains a succinct description of the change. It contains a   
#    type, an optional scope, and a subject
#       + <type> describes the kind of change that this commit is   
#                providing. Allowed types are:

#		             perf:		A code change that improves performance

#		             vendor:	update version for dependencies, packages.

#		             docs:		Documentation only changes

#		             test:		Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
#
#       + <scope> can be anything specifying the place of the commit    
#                 change
#
#       + <subject> is a very short description of the change, in   
#                   the following format:
#             * imperative, present tense: “change” not             
#               “changed”/“changes”
#             * capitalised first letter (based on your team standard)
#             * no dot (.) at the end
#  - The BODY should include the motivation for the change and      
#    contrast this with previous behavior and must be phrased in   
#    imperative present tense 
#
#  - The FOOTER should contain any information about Breaking       
#    Changes and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that   
#    this commit closes
